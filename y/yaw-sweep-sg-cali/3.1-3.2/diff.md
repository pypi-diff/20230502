 ## Project Overview:
 
 Tower strain gauges are commonly used in wind turbine applications to measure the strain on the tower or structure. To ensure accurate readings, it is important to regularly calibrate these gauges. This project aims to develop an automatic routine to generate strain gauge calibration factors (offset and gain) for a given amount of input time-series, considering the zero drift. The validation of the recordings will be pursued through specific idling operations, so called **Yaw Sweeps**. 
 
-bruno- commet yaw sweep
+Basicaly, ***Yaw Sweeps*** are idling operations that might happen for the sake of detwisting the power cable of a wind turbine from time to time (if necessary). As you can see, such operations are not intrinsically related to any kind of calibration routine. However, due the quite linear yaw rotation speed presented during the yaw sweeps, where the turbine is shut down (low wind speeds, zero rotor speed and blades fully pitched), the aerodynamic contributions to the bending moment at the turbine tower are negligible and the only contribution to the bending should be structural (Center of Mass misalignment). And hopefully, the turbine mass is not changing. And by so, the measurements of bending should be constant.
+
+Strain gauges, as stresses measuring devices (and by consequence bending moment) are known for presenting zero-drift over their lifetime. So, we expect, to generate calibration factors that could correct for such offset but also check for the amplitude of the measurements.
 
 
 ## Repo files

+- ***yaw_sweep_sg_cali*** contains the modules from the package that are to calibrate strain gauges in a given wind turbine tower.
 - ***how_to_use.ipynb*** is a Jupyter notebook with an input of only one month. This will facilitate the user to understand the code and  visualize two partial results: the yaw sweep identification and the curve fitting.
 - ***Data*** contains already loaded and saved DTU V52 SQL data(1 min and 50Hz) that will be used (using also Load_data.py). The idea is to save time and help the user to visualize the functioning of the package. This will be further commented below.

 - Package stepwise:
 
 First, identify yaw sweep operations, in which the aerodynamic contribution to the tower bending moment is negligible (low wind speed). Secondly, using such operations, automatically curve fits the raw bending moment signal and extracts relavant information, as max, min, and mean values. Finally, generate recommended calibration factors (offsets). The number of yaw sweeps operation throughout a year is unknown. 
 
 # Lets start running the code :) 
 
+We strongly recommend you to start with the [Jupyter Notebook](https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/python-at-risoe/spp-2023/group_4_shaking_hands/-/blob/main/Final_Project/Yaw_Sweep_SG_Calibration.ipynb) to learn how to use the package.

+Afterwards, the **main.py** description below can further facilitate the usage of the package together with the types of inputs and outputs on each major function, based on their respective docstrings.

 ## Improvements performed from first submission to final submission
 
 - The code was made more robust, adding safety features to avoid the code did not run due to mistakes or missunderstandings. For this, some functions were created to avoid errors and ensure the code run as expected.  
 - The code was check with pycodestyle, to ensure was properly with the recommended standards. 
 - PEP 257 information added to each function
